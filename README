- ahkReload will reload a script, this can be also done by the script as well as ExitApp.
- ahkPause, get and set Pause state of current thread in dll script (dll only)
- ahkExecuteLine, execute a line by passing its pointer, a pointer is returned by addFile and addScript as well as by this function.
- - when no pointer is given, FirstLine pointer is returned, else pointer to next line is returned.
- changed ahkgetvar to return a value rather than passing a variable, so no need to VarSetCapacity anymore.
- fixed ahkFunction ( now using callFuncDll() ) to continue main script after function call.
- fixed to wait for thread to initialize and return then, as well as when script crashes while initializing.
- addScript will not reset previous script anymore.
- removed const for HotkeyIDType Hotkey so sHotkeyCount can be reset for ahkTerminate.

- addScript loads script from text, second parameter is to replace current script
 DllCall(A_AhkPath "\addScript","Str","a:`nMsgBox a`nReturn","ushort",1,"Cdecl UInt")

- \ahkdll function will now load text if specified file does not exist

- no need for #Persistent in AutoHotkey.dll 

17.12.2009

- Changed to "Portable Mode"
	- Instead looking for %My_Documents%\AutoHotkey.ahk, the exe checks for %ExeDir%\ExeName.ahk. 
	- So you can copy AutoHotkey.exe and Script to separate folder then rename the exe to ScriptName.exe and start by double clicking the exe. 
	- You can also start new scripts using your exe that way. 
	  e.g. Run YourExe.exe "%filepath%"

- Changed ahkgetvar to support alias and build in variables. 
- Removed ebiv.cpp because ahkgetvar can be used to get any variable beside clipboard and clipboardall 
- Changed ahkFunction to support up to 10 parameters + return values
