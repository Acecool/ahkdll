- addScript loads script from text, second parameter is to replace current script
 DllCall(A_AhkPath "\addScript","Str","a:`nMsgBox a`nReturn","ushort",1,"Cdecl UInt")

- \ahkdll function will now load text if specified file does not exist

- no need for #Persistent in AutoHotkey.dll

- Changed to "Portable Mode"
	- Instead looking for %My_Documents%\AutoHotkey.ahk, the exe checks for %ExeDir%\ExeName.ahk. 
	- So you can copy AutoHotkey.exe and Script to separate folder then rename the exe to ScriptName.exe and start by double clicking the exe. 
	- You can also start new scripts using your exe that way. 
	  e.g. Run YourExe.exe "%filepath%"

- Changed ahkgetvar to support alias and build in variables. 
- Removed ebiv.cpp because ahkgetvar can be used to get any variable beside clipboard and clipboardall 
- Changed ahkFunction to support up to 10 parameters + return values
